# Metabolic shifts during Drosophila embryogenesis

- `Fly_DFA.m`: MATLAB script used to simulate dynamics of metabolic network based on metabolomics in `FlyData` (PLOS and G3 sheets).
- `FlyPyFBA.ipynb`: Python script driven by Jupyter used to simulate perturbations, such as hypoxia, with FBA, FVA, and pFBA.
- `dFBA_Fly.ipynb`: Python script driven by Jupyter used to simulate dynamics of the amount of extra cellular metabolites with dFBA.
- `AnalysisFlyCFR.ipynb`: Python script driven by Jupyter used to analyze the data generated by `Proteome_CFR/Proteome_CFR.m` script.
- `Proteome_CFR/Proteome_CFR.m`: MATLAB script used to simulate dynamics of metabolic network with the transcriptional/translational constraints using CFR algorithm.
- `AnalysisFlyDFA.ipynb`: Python script driven by Jupyter used to analyze the data generated by `Fly_DFA.m` script.
- `flux_activity_coeff2.m`: MATLAB script for DFA algorithm.
